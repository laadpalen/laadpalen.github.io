⚠️ NOTE: [DUTCH]({% post_url 2022-12-01-update-NL %}) VERSION IS ALWAYS LEADING

Dear pioneer! 

Recently you have showed interest in being part of the pioneersgroup (with or without charling pole) in the BOLD parking garage.

Through this letter we would like to give you an update and ask you to let reply to us.

<u>Background information:</u>

First of all, some background information why it took us a long time to inform you. It is not that easy from a legal point of view to install the infrastructure and divide the costs.
Reasons for this include:

- The infrastructure will eventually become part of the VvE.
- The solution must be future-proof.
- We cannot force every owner to participate, so the investments must be carried by the pioneers and we must make this attractive through a revenue model.
- A perpetual clause must be laid down.

In order to arrange all this properly and integrate it into the VvE, we work together with a lawyer who has devised a construction for the purchase of the infrastructure and the period following purchase. The existence of the pioneer group is also formally recorded. A so-called contractors agreement is entered into for this, in which the pioneer group acts as a contractor on behalf of the VvE. More on this in the future.

<u>De Pioneer with a charging station:</u>

The research done by the lawyer has also shown that it becomes even more complicated if not all pioneers immediately purchase a charging station.

As a result, we had to decide to cancel the choice to become a Pioneer, but not to purchase a charging station. <u>All pioneer group participants will have to purchase a charging station.</u> Because some of you have indicated that you will not need a charging station until later, this may result in pioneers dropping out. Unfortunately, there is no other feasible construction for this that is workable and legally sound.


In addition, the committee is convinced that purchasing a charging station at the start is cheaper and more practical than having it installed later. Even if the charging station is initially not used for a long time. This is due to the strong discount for simultaneous collective purchasing and the expected worldwide cost increase of raw materials and labor.


<u>Explanation of choosing a charging station directly:</u>

![Montly costs](/Assets/montly_costs.png)

Upon delivery of the charging station, the costs for the extended warranty (at € 4.24 per month) are the only monthly costs that start running immediately.
The costs for the “charging point management subscription” only start to run once the charging point has been registered by the owner. This can therefore be done when the charging station is actually needed. Without registration (and therefore without a charging station management subscription), the charging station cannot be used, because the costs for the electricity used cannot be settled.

To determine whether it is financially convenient to install a charging station immediately, or to do this later when the charging station is really needed, we need to divide the difference in placement costs by the €4.24 that is paid immediately per month. 

![Cost difference](/Assets/cost_difference.png)

At the moment it is unclear what exactly the cost difference will be, but several hundred euros is a realistic estimate.
Suppose: Do you think you want to use the charging station within 4 years? In that case, with a cost difference of €200, it is already wise to have a charging station installed immediately.
The higher the cost difference, the more logical it is to have a charging station installed immediately.
 
This is completely separate from convenience, since future charging stations will have to be requested and the term in which it will be installed is unknown.

Conclusion: from a financial and practical point of view, there are strong arguments to have a charging station installed immediately.

<u>The New Quotation:</u>

The previously issued quotation has now expired and has been adjusted. In addition, some necessary options have been added to the quote regarding the infrastructure:
- Load balancing.
This prevents the infrastructure from being switched off if we ever get a form of transport restriction imposed by the network operator, or if we (the VvE power connection) comes dangerously close to peak capacity for other reasons. With Loadbalancing, the charging current is (temporarily) reduced automatically and only at peak times.
- Automatic shutdown in case of fire.
- Fire brigade switch on the outer wall (location to be determined with the board).
- Legal costs.

<u>The costs:</u>

**At the current level of interest (67 pioneers), a charging station costs a total of €3125.82 each.*

The one-off and monthly costs are set out below:
- One-off: Infrastructure costs + legal costs: €2082.19 (with 67 participants!)
The appendix explains the costs for the infrastructure and legal costs per charging station for the stated number of participants. At the time of writing, 67 people are interested.
- One-off: Charging station: €1045,-
These costs are fixed (as long as the offer is valid) and are therefore not dependent on the number of participants as long as we purchase a minimum of 48 charging stations.
We no longer make a distinction between wall and ceiling (bracket) mounting.
- Monthly for a minimum of 5 years: Extended warranty: €4.24 per month, per charging station.
Mandatory extended warranty per month for 5 years, to be paid upon delivery: (We can extend this after 5 years): €4.24 per month per charging station.
- Monthly: Charge point management subscription: €5.00 / €7.00 per month per charge point.
To use your charging station, you need a charging station management subscription (this is also the case with the charging stations that are already in the garage).
You decide when you want it to start and only pay after registering. The costs depend on the subscription you choose. You have plenty of time to carefully consider which subscription you want. If you don't like the subscription, you can always change your subscription.
Once a subscription has started, it will run at least until the end of the extended warranty period (5 years after delivery).
There are two options, the main difference being “roaming”.
<u>With roaming:</u>
If you want all charge cards (ANWB, Vattenfall, Plugsurfing, etc.) to work on your charge point (maybe you have a charge card from your employer..), then you have to take out the Max subscription. For “roaming”, however, €0.02 per kWh is charged to the charge card owner.
<u>No roaming:</u>
Don't have a charge card yet? Are you only going to use the charging station in your parking space? Do you want to charge in the most economical way at your location? Then the “plus subscription” is for you. Please note, you then need a specific charge card and the costs of this (€ 4 per month) are in addition to the costs of the charge point management subscription. This charge card can also be used for public charging in the Netherlands and Europe (+375,000 charge points).

<u>The merits:</u>

Apart from the fact that you have a nice charging station for a favorable price, there is of course a revenue model for every Pioneer as communicated earlier.
Nothing has changed in terms of setup.
Example:
At 67 Pioniers, the costs per charging station are € 3125 each. Of these, €2082.19 are for the infrastructure.
If someone (number 68) wants to have a charging station installed later, that is no problem. They also pay € 2082.19 for the infrastructure and on top of that the price for the charging station (without discount and including possible price increases).
Of the approximately 150 places in the garage without a charging station, 67 are now interested (the Pioneers).
For each charging station that is installed later, each Pioneer receives €31.08 per charging station (€2082.19/67 pioneers).
If the other 83 (150-67) places have all taken a charging station in the long term, you will have received a total amount of €2579.43 (€31.08 X 83 extra charging stations) per Pioneer, per charging station.
Naturally, after each new charging station installed, a periodic payment is made (this is paid via the account of the VvE).

<u>Voting for the changes during ALV meeting:</u>

In addition to approval from the pioneers, approval from the VvE Parking is required. The house rules probably need to be changed. A ALV is required for this and the committee is currently in consultation with the board on how best to approach this.
As soon as more is known about this, we will inform you.

**<u>Action requested:</u>**

For a further continuation of this process, it is very important that you make your final choice known to us. After which you will receive a contract for signing (this will happen after agreement with the VvE board).
We can accept the supplier's offer after all pioneers have signed and paid the contract.
After the final assignment, the lead time for places will take approximately 3 months according to current reports.


We can imagine that you still have questions. Please reach out the the committee if you have any.

Please respons before {{ page.due-date }}.

_<u>Disclaimer:</u>_
_All amounts are inclusive of VAT and subject to price increases.
The price and price increase of the infrastructure and the charging stations is based on the current offer, which has a limited shelf life. Based on the final total demand (i.e. your choice), the quotation may change slightly. Here is the rule: “the more people participate, the cheaper it becomes per charging station”.
Any price increases in the future of charge point management subscription costs have been determined by the supplier.
The commission has no influence on any price increases._
