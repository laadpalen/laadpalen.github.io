<p>Update charging stations</p>

<p>Dear Pioneers,</p>

<p></p>

<p>There is good news and less good news.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We start with the good news: the legal part has been completed.  Our lawyer has devised an excellent construction and put it on paper. 

 In short: the pioneers invest in the realization of the infrastructure.  New participants pay the same amount for the infrastructure as a pioneer, but this amount is divided over and paid back to the pioneers, this is the return on investment. 

 Furthermore, the network will be transferred to the VVE.  So that the management of the infrastructure is invested sustainably. 

 The board agrees with the proposed legal construction.  However, an amendment to the house rules is necessary.   
</p>

<p>Then the less good news: the quoted charging stations are no longer available due to certification problems.  An alternative charging station from this supplier is approximately 1200 euros more expensive. 

 This is reason enough for the committee to look for alternative suppliers. 

 A big downer…    
</p>


<p>So we have to adjust the planning, but by tackling a number of things simultaneously, we hope not to lose too much time. 

 In the coming weeks we will focus on finding another supplier and we will communicate the final choice in due course. 

 In the ALV of May 9 we will vote on the necessary amendment to the house rules. We hope to have the quotation ready before then, to have everyone sign the contract and to collect the money (subject to a positive vote at ALV).  If successful, we can confirm the order to the supplier on May 10 and make the first down payment. 
</p>

<p> Unfortunately, things are not going as fast as hoped. </p>

<p>Sincerely, 
</p>
<p>
 The charging station committee
